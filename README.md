## Issues with Fish

Problems that fish has that bash doesn't have (I love fish as a shell, I just don't think it's good as a scripting language):

- https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/159
- https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1396
- https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/206
- https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2007
- https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/510
- https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4907
- backgrounding fish functions does not exist: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/238
- so I had to make an entire job control system for fish that just calls out to bash: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2036#issuecomment-298495526 …
